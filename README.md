### Building and Running Emulator

To build the project and run the emulator, execute:

```bash
make
```

### Building Project Only

To build the project without running the emulator, use:

```bash
make compile
```

### Specifying Target Platform

You can specify the target platform using `pi=3` or `pi=4`, for example:

```bash
make compile pi=4
```
